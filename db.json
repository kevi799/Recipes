      "instructions": "There are many ways to cook beef, including roasting, broiling, grilling, pan frying, and stewing: \nRoasting: Preheat the oven, season the beef, and roast for a time based on the desired level of doneness. You can also baste the beef with its own juices while it cooks. \nGrilling: Charcoal grills work best for barbecuing beef, but you can also use a gas grill with a separate basket. Brisket, ribs, and chuck primal cuts are good for barbecue. \nPan frying: This method works best for thin and tender cuts of beef. \nStewing: Add beef, vegetables, and seasoning to the pot. \nBraising and pot-roasting: These combination cooking methods are good for tougher cuts of beef. \nSkillet/oven: This method is good for steaks that are at least 1 1/2 inches thick. You can start the steak in the skillet and finish it in the oven, or vice versa. "
